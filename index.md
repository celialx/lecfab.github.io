## Overview

Hello, I am a French graduate student in Computer Sciences at [ENS de Lyon](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/). My main interests are probabilities, complex systems, data analysis and theoretical physics (that I studied for one year in Germany). Next September, I will go back to Lyon to finish my masters. In the meantime, I am taking a year off to focus on extracurricular passions: traveling in mysterious places, playing music, learning languages and reading a lot more than usual.

Feel free to send an email for any comment or question!

## Education

After two years in French "Classes pr√©paratoires" in Science, I was admitted in ENS de Lyon, one of the top-ranking schools for research, where I got a bachelor and started a master. Thanks to the Erasmus exchange program, I could spend one year in Munich studying physics. My studies are meant to be finished in June 2020.

## Work and research

The school in which I study is focussed on research and enabled me to carry out various projects: two research internships (two months of bioinformatics modelizing genes interaction and six months analyzing data about health networks), and a year-long work on a communication system for physically disabled people (based on electroencephalography and natural language processing).

As for the programming aspect of CS, I loved it since I was a teen and started developing an online game in PHP/SQL. Later, I used various languages and was hired as a part-time frontend developer in Munich.

## Personal interests

Instrumental music is an intense passion. I spend hours playing the piano every time there is one, and I sometimes practice the accordion or the viola. During the last years, I sang with classical choirs in Lyon, Munich and Paris.

Learning languages is very appealing to me, so I make up for my lazy youth by working hard on German and Spanish while trying to improve my English.

I like sports to some extent, especially swimming, cycling and volleyball, but never do them very seriously!
